\arguments{
\item{donor_names}{Character vector of donor names to compare (length 1 or more).}

\item{by}{One of "earmarking", "region", or "country". The dimension to compare.}

\item{avg_method}{If only one donor is supplied, how to compute the "others" comparator:
- "mean_of_donors": Each donor counts equally, regardless of their total funding
- "pooled": Donors are weighted by their share of total funding (larger donors have more influence)}

\item{display_mode}{Comparison mode:
- "absolute": Compare absolute USD amounts (sum vs sum)
- "relative": Compare percentage shares of total funding (profile vs average profile)}

\item{year}{Optional numeric/integer vector. Year(s) to filter on.}

\item{unhcr_region}{Optional character vector. Filter for UNHCR region(s).}

\item{programme_lab}{Optional character vector. Filter for programme name.}

\item{iati_identifier_ops}{Optional character vector. Filter for operation ID.}

\item{ctr_name}{Optional character vector. Filter for country name.}

\item{top_n}{Integer. The number of top categories to show when `by = "country"`.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing overlaid bars for comparison.
}
\description{
Creates an overlaid bar chart to compare funding profiles of donors based on
a selected dimension (earmarking, region, or country). When only one donor 
is provided, a comparator is automatically added based on other donors.
}
\details{
When `display_mode = "relative"` and a comparator is added:
- Selected donor: Percentage share of its own total funding
- Comparator: Average percentage share across other donors (using `avg_method`)

When `display_mode = "absolute"` and a comparator is added:
- Selected donor: Absolute USD amounts
- Comparator: Either:
  - With `avg_method = "mean_of_donors"`: Average donor size × average share
  - With `avg_method = "pooled"`: Summed totals across all other donors

The chart uses visual cues to distinguish series:
- Wider transparent bars: Comparator
- Narrower solid bars: Selected donor(s)
- Colors represent categories within the dimension
