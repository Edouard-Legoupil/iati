\description{
This function plots the earmarking composition of incoming commitments for a donor.
Depending on `by`, it shows a single global bar chart, bars by year, or stacked bars by
region/country/sector. All bar charts are ordered by total descending amount, except
for date grouping which is ordered chronologically.
